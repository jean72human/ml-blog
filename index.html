Hello! My name is Gbetondji, and I am an aspiring researcher with a passion for machine learning.
I am currently pursuing a masters in machine intelligence at the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Mbour, Senegal. I like reading about optimization in deep learning, neural architecture search and transfer learning. </br>
</br>
Here I write about artificial intelligence, things I found interesting, competitions I participated in on the blog page 
<a href="https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/blog/">here</a>, and research projects on the research page <a href="https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/research/">here</a>.
