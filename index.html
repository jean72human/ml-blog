Hello! My name is Gbetondji and I am an undergrad with a passion for machine learning.
I like working on machine learning, transfer learning, meta-learning and reinforcement learning.
My most recent interest is in AI generating algorithms.
Here I post what I have worked on, and things I think others might find interesting.
