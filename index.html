Hello! My name is Gbetondji and I am an aspiring researcher with a passion for machine learning.
I like working on machine learning, transfer learning, meta-learning and reinforcement learning.
My most recent interest is in AI generating algorithms.

Here I write here about artificial intelligence, things I found interesting, competitions I participated in, and research projects.
