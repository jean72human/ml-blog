> "AMMI is a novel fully funded one-year intensive graduate program that provides brilliant young Africans with state-of-the-art training in machine learning and its applications.

The AMMI program will prepare well rounded machine intelligence researchers who respond to both present and future needs of Africa and the world.".

In January 2021, I started a masters degree at the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Mbour Senegal. The African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) is an "intensive masters" programs sponsored by Google and Facebook. We will be taking courses on topics ranging from the fundations of machine learning to natural language processing and computer vision. I thought it would be great to write notes on some important points that are discussed during classes. I will be organizing the notes here. Each note will be a jupyter notebook article so there will also be a "open in colab" button at the top which is great for articles that contain code.

## Foundations of machine learning 
- [Ordinary least sqaure solution](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/02/20/ordinary-least-square-solution.html)
- [Ridge regression solutions](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/02/20/ridge-equality.html)
- [Maximum likelihood estimation and maximum a posteriori estimation](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/03/05/mle-and-map.html)
- [Polynomial regression and overfitting](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/03/04/poynomial-regression-and-overfitting.html)
- [MLE and MAP for logistic regression](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/03/10/mle-and-map-logistic-regression.html)

So that's all for now. I will be updating this article as we progress in the program. Comments are apreciated.
