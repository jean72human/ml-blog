In January 2021, I started a masters degree at the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Mbour Senegal. The African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) is an "intensive masters" programs sponsored by Google and Facebook. We will be taking courses on topics ranging from the fundations of machine learning to natural language processing and computer vision. I thought it would be great to write notes on some important points that are discussed during classes. I will be organizing the notes here. Each note will be a jupyter notebook article so there will also be a "open in colab" button at the top which is great for articles that contain code.

## Foundations of machine learning 
- [Ordinary least square solution](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/02/20/ordinary-least-square-solution.html)
- [Ridge regression solutions](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/02/20/ridge-equality.html)
- [Maximum likelihood estimation and maximum a posteriori estimation](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/03/05/mle-and-map.html)
- [Polynomial regression and overfitting](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/03/04/poynomial-regression-and-overfitting.html)
- [MLE and MAP for logistic regression](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/03/10/mle-and-map-logistic-regression.html)
## Natural language processing
- [Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis](https://jean72human.github.io/ml-blog/notes/ammi/blog/2021/04/26/_04_27_naive_bayes_classifier.html)

So that's all for now. I will be updating this article as we progress in the program. Comments are apreciated.
