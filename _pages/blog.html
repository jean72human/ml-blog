<h2>Blog</h2>

<P>
    Here are my blog articles that are not related to any research projects in particular. I will post about side projects here, as well as my learning experiences, technologies I fall in love with and data science competitions I enter.
</P>
{% assign category_name = 'blog'%}

{%- if page.list_title -%}
    <h2 class="post-list-heading">{{ page.list_title }}</h2>
{%- endif -%}
<ul class="post-list">
{%- assign date_format = site.minima.date_format | default: "%b %-d, %Y" -%}
{% for post in site.categories[category_name] %}

    {%- include post_list_image_card.html -%}
